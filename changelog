Changes for bunhax...

Reminder: All files must be placed in same directory unless you edit the source (please dont). Requires root access.

Changes * 0.2.4-rb
*********************************
- Added bunhax project to GitHub (https://github.com/deado/bunhax)
- A lot of cleaning took place. (ie. closing files after done with them rather than letting close from 'end', having 2 files open at one time.)
- All moving now uses /bin/echo. Should help just in case there might be a moving error.
- Offers to install itself to /etc/bunhax/ making symlink /sbin/bunhax (uninstall also available).
- Added '.bunhax.conf' for program preferences and system settings.
- Added classes: Parse, Sync
- Checks to see if kernel was compiled with cpuset support.
- Looks for /dev/cpuset and existing setup. Creates and mounts.
- Checks to see if cpusets are currently mounted.
- Saves your cpuset layout for easy and quick resetup after reboots.
- Please remember to report any error or bugs. Even if you fix them too, feel free to include your fix as well. Most problems become known from feedback and get fixed!
- Updated to see new current cpu the task is running on.


Changes * 0.2.3-rb
*********************************
- Fixed code for checking usable CPUs for each cpuset.
- Added cpuset editing feature. Allows you to change a cpuset's usable cpus and mems.
- Changed code used to write to files. Using built-in ruby function for better stability.
- Made change to interactive mode cpuset listing. Wasn't updating properly after adding the editing feature.
- Changed several if statements and while loops for more compact code and easier to read. 
- Random code clean ups. Got rid of some unneeded statements laying around.


Changes * 0.2.2-rb
*********************************
- Changed the way bunhax gets information about pids to correct crashing problem. (thx daf)
- Corresponding with above, changed pid moving to prevent future issues.
- Added standard error reporting. Help diag future issues.


Changes * 0.2.1-rb
*********************************
- Corrected creating of cpusets. Editing files "/dev/cpuset/MySet/cpus" and "./mems" is no longer needed, unless editing after creation. 
- Edited output when listing current cpusets to show which cpus it can use and how many tasks are currently attached to that cpuset.
- Removed color toggling (on/off). Wasnt working properly so its back to the drawing board. Will be re-added in a later release
- Changed contact information in version block
- Removed all options for GUI mode... considering it does not exist.
- Removed -beta tag. Bunhax is still, and will be in beta stage for a long time to come. Everyone knows this.
- I am aware of an issue when printing tasks of it stopping and printing the usage. Does not always happen.. I am looking into this. Will be fixed in a future
release


Changes * 0.2.0-rb-beta
*********************************
- Not really sure what changed... I didnt record it!


Changes * 0.1.9-rb-beta
*********************************
- Split into different files for easier bug tracking and organization
- Edited the parsing of /proc/PID/stat to grab corrent cpu number.
	i know this was working before but now for some reason it doesnt.. i hope it works for others!
- Fixed typo on the Usage message. Showed 'bunhax.rb -p=CPUSET' which clearly did not work. correct syntax 'bunhax.rb -p CPUSET'
- Started changelog
